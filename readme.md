### History
#### 04/12/2023 - Git creation

On this day I have created the git repository to upload my first 'naive' tries. I had not used Git for 1 year so it was quite troublesome. This files were push on the 'naive' branch. It contained the files 'Freq_inc.py', 'open_images.py' and 'slice_vid.py'. The first one contains a naive model of convolution that aims to generate an image given 2 images from a video that was sliced by the 2 other files (slice_vid.py had better performances so we only used slice_vid).
